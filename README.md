### GitHub
<p> What I learned with the GitHub assignment is that it can be really annoying to deal with merge conflicts. The best way to get around this is clear communication with team members and consistency in the way that you are editing something in your repository.</p> 

### AWS
<p>With a little help from someone with a lot more money than I have, it is actually fairly simple to launch a nice webserver. </p>
<p>This is my server's IP address: <b>3.132.231.194</b>. And this is the command to ssh in: <b>ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@3.132.231.194</b>. </p>

### DNS
<p>My domain name is <b>https://chickenlittle.click</b>. I do not wish to justify myself in this decision. I learned that renting a domain name can be fairly simply but the set up is complicated if you don't know what you are doing. </p>

### HTTPS
<p>With this assignment I learned how to request a certificate so that your website can be secure. Secure websites are super important in order to protect information of visitors and of the owners as well. Now in order to go to a subdomain of my website I have to actually have created one. </p>

### HTML Intro
<p>I learned about the basic structure of HTML documents and how to add tables and images. It was fairly simple, although I do want to remember that as class is a classification and not the same as a class in object oriented programming at all. </p> 
<p>The terminal command to deploy the main page of my website is: <b>./deployWebsite.sh -k {path to key} -h {domainname}</b></p>

### Simon HTML
<p>I learned a lot about how the structure of HTML actually works. I think that I am finally starting to get the basic ideas down. By studying the deployment script for this project I also learned a few things about how writing scripts actually works, although this did raise some questions for me as well. I learned about the importance of pushing to GitHub often as well. </p>
<p> The terminal command to deploy is: <b>./deployFiles.sh -k {path to key} -h {domainname} -s {which service}</b></p>

### CSS
<p> I learned that sometimes the best teacher is trial and error. There are a lot of ways you can manipulate the structure of HTML with CSS to make visually interesting animations. However, this takes practice and ultimately is a skill to develop over time. </p>
<p> The link to the most helpful reference guide I used in this assignment was: <b> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation </b> </p>


### CSS: Responsive Display
<p> I learned that there are several rather difficult elements to making CSS responsive to display size. Of course a very important part is the metadata head that can be included in the HTML, <b> meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" </b> Additionally, the display in CSS can be changed to grid or flex or float to accomplish all sort of different things. </p>
