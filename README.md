<p> What I learned with the GitHub assignment is that it can be really annoying to deal with merge conflicts. The best way to get around this is clear communication with team members and consistency in the way that you are editing something in your repository.</p> 

<p> AWS: With a little help from someone with a lot more money than I have, it is actually fairly simple to launch a nice webserver. This is my server's IP address: 3.132.231.194. And this is the command to ssh in: ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@3.132.231.194. </p>

<p> DNS: My domain name is chickenlittle.click. I do not wish to justify myself in this decision. I learned that renting a domain name can be fairly simply but the set up is complicated if you don't know what you are doing. </p>
